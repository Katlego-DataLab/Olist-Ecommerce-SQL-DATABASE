BESTIE 🔥 this project is already VERY strong. I’ll give you a **professional, recruiter-level README** that makes it stand out on GitHub.



# Olist E-Commerce Analytical Database

**Author:** Katlego Mathebula
**Tech Stack:** PostgreSQL, SQL, Data Modeling, Business Intelligence
**Project Type:** End-to-End Data Engineering & Analytics



## Project Overview

This project is a complete end-to-end **relational database design and business intelligence analysis** built using the Olist e-commerce dataset.

It demonstrates:

-  Database schema design
-  Data integrity enforcement
-  Index optimization
-  Data validation & cleaning
-  Advanced SQL analytics
-  Business performance metrics
-  Window functions & cohort analysis

The goal was to transform raw e-commerce data into a structured, optimized, and analytics-ready relational database.



## Business Problem

E-commerce companies generate large volumes of transactional data, but raw data alone does not provide insights.

The key business challenges addressed in this project include:

-  Understanding revenue performance
-  Identifying top customers
-  Measuring customer retention
-  Analyzing repeat purchase behavior
-  Tracking monthly revenue trends
-  Improving data quality and consistency
-  Optimizing database performance for analytics

This project simulates a real-world business intelligence environment where data must support strategic decision-making.



## Database Architecture

The database was designed using normalized relational principles.

### Tables Created:

-  `customers`
-  `sellers`
-  `products`
-  `orders`
- `order_items`
-  `payments`
-  `reviews`
-  `geolocation`
-  `product_category_translation`

## Key Features:

* Primary Keys
* Foreign Key Relationships
* Composite Keys
* Referential Integrity
* Constraints (NOT NULL, CHECK)
* Proper Data Types

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimization

To improve query performance, indexes were created on:

* Customer IDs
* Order dates
* Product IDs
* Seller IDs
* Payment records
* Review records

This ensures faster joins and analytics queries on large datasets.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Quality Control

Data quality was enforced using:

### ✔ NOT NULL Constraints

### ✔ CHECK Constraints:

* Review scores (1–5)
* Positive prices
* Positive payment values
* Valid order statuses

### ✔ Handling Missing Values

* Standardized null product dimensions
* Ensured data consistency across tables

---

## 📈 Business Intelligence Metrics

This project includes real-world performance indicators:

### 🔹 Revenue Analysis

* Total Revenue
* Monthly Revenue Trend
* Cumulative Revenue (Running Total)

### 🔹 Sales Performance

* Total Orders
* Average Order Value

### 🔹 Customer Analytics

* Customer Lifetime Value (Top 10)
* Repeat Purchase Rate
* Customer Retention Cohort Analysis
* Ranked Customers using `RANK()`

---

## 🧠 Advanced SQL Techniques Used

* `JOIN` operations
* Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)
* `GROUP BY`
* `DATE_TRUNC`
* Window functions:

  * `RANK()`
  * `SUM() OVER()`
* Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
* Cohort analysis logic
* Filtering with `FILTER`
* Subqueries

---

## 📊 Analytical Insights Enabled

This database supports:

* Revenue forecasting
* Customer segmentation
* Retention modeling
* Sales performance tracking
* Business growth analysis
* Strategic decision-making
